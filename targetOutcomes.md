For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section for Study 1.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> An independent-samples t test with compatibility condition(compatible vs. incompatible) as the independentvariable and the perceived difference betweenRomney’s and Obama’s general ideologies as the dependent variable showed a significant differencebetween conditions. Specifically, participants in theincompatible condition perceived the differencebetween the candidates’ ideologies as smaller than didparticipants in the compatible condition, t(237) = 2.06,p = .04, d = 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) for themean difference = [0.02, 1.08] (see Table 1 for meansand standard deviations).4 Additionally, participants inthe incompatible condition perceived the differencebetween the candidates’ stances on specific politicalissues as smaller than did participants in the compatiblecondition, t(237) = 2.38, p = .02, d = 0.31, 95% CIfor the mean difference = [0.08, 0.82] (see Table 1).
